% Default Melonly application structure consists of several main folders containing source code. It's a good idea to explore them!

## `/database`

% In this directory database migrations are created. You may also store SQLite database there.

## `/public`

% This is the place where you should put client-side things like CSS styles, JavaScript files and other assets that should be publicly accessible.

## `/src`

% The `src` directory contains your main application code. Feel free to modify and adjust it to your needs.

## `/storage`

% In `/storage` directory are stored things like cache and temporary files. TypeScript code is compiled into `dist` directory inside this folder. You don't need to modify anything there.

## `/tests`

% This directory stores your unit tests (test files end with `.test.ts` extension).

## `/views`

% The `views` directory contains app views rendered by your application. View files have the `.melon.html` extension.
